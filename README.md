Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game
===============================

This is the third project for my Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree curriculum. The purpose of this project is to showcase my Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas skills. Udacity made it fun to learn Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas by assigning a game as a project.

## Objective
The object of the game is to collect as many stars as possible and make it across the cobblestone path. The challenge is to avoid the Enemies.

### Player movement
Move the player by using the arrow keys: up. down, left, and right.

### Enemies
When the player is hit by a bug, player must hit "Enter" to reset the game.

> Hint: The enemies run at different speeds

### You Win!
When the player makes it across the cobblestone path, player must hit "Enter" to reset the game.

### Stars
Player can collect stars with their star count displayed. When the player wins or loses, the star count is reset.

### Known Bugs
Trying to make the enemies not be able to run through/over/on top of other bugs or stars. I believe the cleanest way this can be fixed by resizing all sprites to a power of two size, putting them on a spritesheet and refactoring all code to reflect changes.
